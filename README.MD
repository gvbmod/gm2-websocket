# Gvbvdxx Mod 2 - Websockets Extension Server

This is a fully remade version of the original websockets server for Gvbvdxx Mod 1.0 and 2.0

# Configuration

Things can be configured inside server.js (from the root directory).

# Requirements (To run the server)

Node.JS and NPM

# Installation

First, download the full Gvbvdxx Mod 2 Source Code Pack (Remove the other source code if you don't plan to be using the other ones).

Next, open your terminal and type ```npm install``` inside the root directory of the server source code.

Finally, after the installation is done, type ```npm run start``` and the server will start.

You can make an account and then add in the source code by yourself.
